# Betsy
A new programming language for fun.

Inspired by Porth, Betsy is a programming language project to develop a simple programming language and learn c at the same time.
I do not know what i am doing, but that is the fun in it.

### Goals:
- [X] Written in c.
- [X] Compiles to c.
- [ ] Turing complete.
- [ ] Staticly and strongly typed.
- [ ] Compiles to c, and then to a native executable automatically.
- [ ] Support for first class functions.
- [ ] Interfaces with static libraries.
